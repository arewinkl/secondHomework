#-Howemork assignment #2 

*-The goal of this assignment was to take the time to develop or own portfoilio with links to a bio and a contact form for them to be able to contact us. Since this is the begining of our learning we were tasked with using a website called Bootstrap, which simplifys everything by giving you code for different website elements like __navigation, jumbotrons, etc__.
*-The requirements for this assignment was that we create a __nav bar__ with working links to every page that we designed. There needs to be responsive images on the pages. The elemenst such as tables need to be included, and also be responsive with media querys.

##-Elements:

**index2.html**
*-The first element that I included was on the bio page and on every subsequent page, and that was the naviagation bar. This allowed the used to click on the different tabs and be redirected to the apropriate page.

*-The second element was the __jumbotron__ which was included to display a large image that stretched across the whole screen no matter the size.

*-Then there is a text section that has some information about who I am as a person and what drove me to be a coder.

*-Finally there is a second __responsive image__ and this one is located at the bottom of the page.

**contact**
*-The Contact form was designed specifically for ease of use, so that it is extreemly easy for someone to fill out and contact me.

*-The navigation bar is the exact same that I have on every other page and allows people to flip back and forth between multiple pages.

*-The form has multiple sections. the first of which shows some of my personal contact infromation if they want to contact me. Then there is a form that allows them to input there own information and lets them add extensive comments to let me know exactly what they are interested in learning more about.

**portfolio.html**
*-This page is simply there to show what work I have completed to show to future employers. Currently there is no work to put in there so I added some boxes to represent the layout of how I would like to have for my portfolio.

*-The portfolio images and boxes are all designed to be responsive to __media queries__.
