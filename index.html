            <p class="card-text">
                Hey my name is Alec Rewinkel, and I currently live in Denver, Colorado the same place where i was born and raised. I can't imagine growing up anywhere else. Colorado has so many amazing thngs to offer! when im not busy working, I love to get outside and enjoy all of the amazing beauty that this state has to offer.
                I atteneded college at the Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. While there I recieved a Bachelors in Science with a concentration in Sports Medicine, a Bachelors of Economics, and a minor in Buisness Administration. Needless to say I didn't have much free time while I was there, but I enjoyed every second of it.
                <br>
                As far as my career, I have dedicated my time to being a personal trainer and helping my clients reach their health and fitness goals. This is an extreemly rewarding job, because you get to show people what they are truly capable of when the put their mind to it. I have spent years keeping up and the newest research and training techniques that the health and science field has to offer. I abosolutely love training myself and others but, this past year I found myself yearning for a new challenge, but wasn't sure how to take the leap. Then to everyones suprise a global pandemic took place, the size of which we couldn't of imagined in our wildest dreams. Not being able to work, presented me with the dilema of waiting to see if things would get better, or use this oportunity to finally take that leap into coding.
                <br>
                Well I abosolutely took that leap and I cannot be happier with the results, becoming a coder is something that I had thought about for years, but never knew where to began. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and began devouring as much coding infromation as I could get my hands on. I abosolutely love codding and am extreemly excited to be finally embarking on my coding career!

            <p class="card-text">I have found that the best way to clear my head, is to get as close to nature as possible. Whether that means going for a walk in your local park, or mountain climbing as pictured in the image below. I highly recommend taking some personal time and treat yourself to a hike. </p>
